# Auto clicker for banana game
## You can really just use this for any clicker game, the program is very simple:
- Press enter when your mouse is hovered over the part you want to click
- press `e` to exit
- This thing should click once about every 0.001 of a second (The banana game doesnt let it click that fast though)
- This also depends on your processing speeds and how fast your computer is too
- The script was originally created in `python 3` but I made an .exe so you don't have to install python JUST for this
- If you do, than after installing `python 3` or newer, remember to `pip install` all of my imports: `keyboard`, `pywin32`, and the rest are built into python
- If you are downloading the `.exe` idk if you have to download the `.spec` file too, but I don't think

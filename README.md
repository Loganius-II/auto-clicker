# Auto clicker for banana game
## You can really just use this for any clicker game, the program is very simple:
- Press *q* to start
- Press *e* to stop (you can start and stop as many times as you want)
- Press *`* to exit force close the code
- This thing should click once about every 0.001 of a second (The banana game doesnt let it click that fast though)
- This also depends on your processing speeds and how fast your computer is too
- The script was originally created in `python 3` but I made an .exe so you don't have to install python JUST for this
- If you do, than after installing `python 3` or newer, remember to `pip install` all of my imports: `keyboard`, `pywin32`, and the rest are built into python

#### When you run the .exe it will appear as nothing shows up. No console. That is on purpose so you dont look suspicious. Just press the buttons as described above
